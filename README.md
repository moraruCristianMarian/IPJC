# The Relativity Paradox: Einstein's Odyssey 💫🧪

The Relativity Paradox: Einstein's Odyssey is a 2D platformer developed as our first project in Unity for the Introduction to Game Design Class. The goal was to create a functional game by the end of the semester, incorporating a variety of game development concepts such as triggers, collisions, raycasting, NPCs, and local storage.

## 🚀 Game Overwiew 
Inspired by classics like Super Mario and Dead Cells, we decided on a platformer, but with a twist! The Relativity Paradox features Albert Einstein as the protagonist, navigating through a galaxy filled with challenges and puzzles.

Your mission? Help Einstein escape the evil aliens and get to the safety of the portal by solving puzzles and making use of all the special power-ups along the way.

## ☄️ Gravity Mechanics
Our game introduces a unique twist: the gravity modification system controlled through the arrow keys!

- **Adjust Gravity Angle**: Change the direction of gravity with the arrow keys
- **Toggle Global Gravity**: Switch between local gravity for the player and global gravity affecting all game objects.

## ⏲️ Time Travel
But wait, there more! Albert Einstein also has the ability to manipulate time, allowing him to travel 3 seconds into the past. This ability becomes quite useful when solving puzzles and it tends to get him out of some siticky situtations.
